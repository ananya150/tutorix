# Step 2 Test Sequence: Grid-Based AI System Validation

## Overview
This test sequence validates that our grid-based AI system correctly:
- Detects content types from instructions
- Positions content using semantic grid layout
- Applies appropriate styling for each content type
- Maintains educational flow and proper spacing

## Test Instructions
1. **Clear the canvas** before starting (refresh page if needed)
2. **Enter each prompt exactly as written** in the input field
3. **Wait for each response** before entering the next prompt
4. **Check the expected results** after each prompt

## Expected Canvas Layout

After all tests, your canvas should look like this:

```
Row 1:  [      Newton's Laws of Motion        ] ‚Üê Title (centered)
Row 2:  [                                     ] ‚Üê Spacing
Row 3:  [First Law of Motion                  ] ‚Üê Heading (left)
Row 4:  [An object at rest stays at rest...   ] ‚Üê Definition (full width)
Row 5:  [‚Ä¢ Key points about inertia           ] ‚Üê Bullet (indented)
Row 6:  [1. Steps to calculate force          ] ‚Üê Numbered (indented)
Row 7:  [         F = ma                      ] ‚Üê Formula (centered)
Row 8:  [Example of first law in action       ] ‚Üê Example (highlighted)
Row 9:  [                    Historical note  ] ‚Üê Note (right-aligned)

## Troubleshooting

If any test fails:

1. **Check Console Output**: Look for the shape object in browser/server console
2. **Verify Content Type**: Check `meta.contentType` in the shape
3. **Check Grid Position**: Look for `meta.gridPosition` JSON string
4. **Validate Coordinates**: Ensure x,y are numbers, not undefined
5. **Review Detection Logic**: Check if instruction keywords triggered correct detection

## Performance Notes

- Each request should be faster than the old coordinate-based system
- AI context is much smaller (only current row + recent content)
- No complex spatial calculations needed
- Grid positioning is deterministic and consistent
